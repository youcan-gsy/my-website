  U1 AE1 Para.3.4

3 Identity traits can be ascribed, achieved or chosen. An ascribed trait is one that you are born with; examples include your ethnicity, your birthplace, and being the child and possibly the sibling of certain people. An achieved trait is one you work for, such as being a university graduate or the employee of a certain company. An identity such as a club membership or affiliation with a political party is chosen.
一个人的身份特征是可以被赋予的、努力获取的或主动选择的。被赋予的是你与生俱来的特征，例如你的种族、出生地，以及某人的孩子或手足。努力获取的是你为之付出努力而获得的特征，比如大学毕业生或者某公司雇员的身份。俱乐部会员或政党成员的身份则是你所选择的。
4 However, traits are not always so easy to categorize. Is speaking your native language, for example, ascribed (because you were born into the family and country where that language was spoken), achieved (because you studied the language and became more proficient), or even chosen (if you grew up in a multilingual country, but preferred one language over another)? 
然而，身份特征并不总是这么容易归类。举个例子，你的母语是被赋予的特征(理由是你出生在讲这种语言的家庭和国家)，还是你所获取的特征( 理由是你通过学习，更加精通这门语言)，抑或是你所选择的特征(设想你在-一个多语言的国家长大，而你更倾向于使用其中的一-种语言) ?

U2AE1Para. 5.6
5 If this seems a hard notion to understand, then consider it in light of another Japanese philosophy, that of wabi-sabi. This is harder to translate into English, but it refers to the combination of three beliefs that nothing is permanent, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect. Applied to arts and crafts, it explains why the Japanese traditionally value handmade objects. Even though they look less perfect than those made by machine, it is actually this imperfection that makes them beautiful. In fact, artists who value the wabi-sabi aesthetic create works that are deliberately imperfect, such as a bowl that isn't entirely round or a vase with a thumbprint visible in the clay. Rough surfaces, instead of ones smoothed by machines, are common in wabi-sabi ceramics, and often the pieces are not glazed or colored.
如果觉得这个概念难以理解，可以借助另一种日本哲学思想来理解，那就是“侘寂”。这个词很难翻译成英文，但它主要指三种信念的组合：世间万物没有永恒、没有终结、没有完美。应用到艺术和手工艺上，它能说明为何日本人自古重视手工制品。即使看上去不如机器制品完美，但正是不完美成就其美。实际上，看重“侘寂”美学的艺术家会创作故意留有缺陷的作品，比如不够浑圆的碗、陶土上留有指纹印的花瓶。“侘寂”陶器往往表面粗糙，不像机器打磨的那样光滑，而且往往不上釉、不涂彩。
6 It's not just Japan that has such a tradition, however. A similar idea can be found in Iran, among the makers of Persian rugs. Tradition has it that those who weave carpets will deliberately include one small flaw, as recognition of the fact that nothing can be perfect. The intentional mistake reminds them to be modest about their work. Similarly, some early American settlers known as the Puritans included a "humility square" when they sewed a quilt – one square that didn't match the rest of the blanket. Some Native American bead workers would include an intentional "mistake bead" for the same reason.
不过，不只是日本才有这样的传统。在伊朗，波斯地毯织造者也有类似的理念。相传织地毯的人会故意留下一个小小的瑕疵，以彰显世事无完美这一事实。故意而为的错误提醒他们对自己的作品保持谦逊的态度。一些早期美国移民，例如清教徒，也有类似传统。他们在缝制被子的时候会留一块“谦逊之角”——和被子其他地方不搭配的小方块。出于同样的原因，一些美洲印第安串珠工会故意串一颗“错误珠子”。

2 Around the world there have been many outbreaks of cholera that have killed millions of people. During the First Industrial Revolution, the disease started to become an even bigger killer. Transported between major towns and cities by people buying and selling goods, once the disease reached a new area, many people were quickly infected, and it caused many pandemics. A pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that rapidly leads to large numbers of people being affected. As more and more people moved to cities, the infrastructure of many places did not undergo a development process at the required rate. Sewers were not built quickly enough to take human waste away, and many major rivers and other sources of water became polluted.
2 世界各地暴发过许多次霍乱，夺走了数百万人的生命。在第一次工业革命期间，这种疾病的杀伤力更大。 该疾病借由买卖货物的人在主要城镇之间传播，一旦传播至一个新的地区，就会有许多人很快被感染，这造成了许多次疾病大流行。疾病大流行是指一种疾病的大暴发，它会迅速导致大批人受到影响。随着越来越多的人涌入城市，许多地方的基础设施开发速度滞后。下水道的建造速度不够快，无法将人的排泄物及时带走，因此，许多主要河流和其他水源都遭到了污染。
2 On a simplistic level, a country's economic output diminishes due to the number of productive days lost from the impact of diseases and illnesses. It is virtually impossible to say precisely which diseases and illnesses have the most significant economic impact. However, millions of days are lost each year due to health-related issues. From stress, through to muscular injuries and serious long-term illnesses, a country can lose billions of dollars of revenue.
简单来讲，疾病会减少生产天数，从而导致一个国家的经济产出减少。要确切地说出哪些疾病对经济的影响最大几乎是不可能的。但是，由于健康相关的问题，每年有数百万个工作日被损失掉。从精神压力到肌肉损伤和严重的长期疾病，一个国家可能因此损失数十亿美元的收入。

U4AE1Para. 3.5
3 Some languages die and others become widely used for a variety of reasons. Some are historical and relate to when a small number of nations and their languages spread to different parts of the world. Some languages faced discrimination and were even banned. Others were still used, but because powerful groups preferred a different language, they became less common. Once a language achieves a superior position in society, because it is either enforced through law, or has a special status in education, it makes it hard for other languages to survive. However, historically, and even today, arguably the main reason for the death of a language is commerce. 
当一些语言消亡时，另一些语言却由于各种原因而被广泛使用。其中有些是历史原因，与一小部分国家及其语言散布在世界的不同地区有关。有的语言受到歧视，甚至被禁用。有的语言仍然被使用，但由于强势群体偏好其他语言，它们逐渐变得不那么通用了。一旦某种语言在社会上占据优势地位时——被法律强制要求，或在教育中拥有特殊地位——它就会导致其他语言难以生存。然而，从古至今，商业活动可以说是导致语言死亡的主要原因。
5 Some argue that losing a language is to lose more than simply its words, grammar, and pronunciation. With it, we lose cultural knowledge and identity. To protect the language, it needs to be given a special status within a society. If there is no need to use a language, or people have little opportunity to use it, then it will ultimately stop existing. Some languages already have so few speakers that the aim now is simply to record the languages before the last speakers die. However, for minority languages with more speakers, there is much that can be done to enable their survival.
有人认为，一种语言的消亡不仅仅意味着字词、语法和语音的消失，其承载的文化和身份认同也会一并丧失。要保护一门语言，就要在社会中给予它特殊的地位。如果人们没有使用某种语言的需求，或者几乎没有机会使用它，那么它终将走向消亡。有些语言的使用者已经所剩无几，现在能做的只有在最后一位说这门语言的人过世前将这些语言记录下来。不过，对于使用人数较多的少数族裔语言来说，要使它们的生命得以延续，能做的事情有很多。

U5AE1Para. 2.3
2 The law is a set of written rules and regulations, usually created by a legal institute or their representatives, such as judges and the government. It is thought to be accepted by the whole of society and something that is recognized and maintained by powers such as the police. Laws are created to keep the social order and to maintain peace and justice. They are there to protect the general public. The law clearly defines the things a person can or cannot do. If a law is broken, a punishment is enforced. This punishment varies depending on the significance of the crime. In general, most laws are created by society's ethical interpretations of right and wrong. However, ethics differs significantly from law.
法律是一系列成文的条例和规定，通常由立法机关或他们的代理人比如法官或政府创立，被认为是为全社会所接受，同时由执法机关如警察认可并维护。法律的创立是为了维持社会秩序，守护和平正义，保护普罗大众。 法律明确规定一个人可以做什么，不可以做什么。如果违法，就会受到强制性的惩罚。惩罚的力度取决于犯罪的严重程度。总体而言，大多数法律是基于社会对是非的道德解释而创立的。但道德与法律大有不同。
3 As stated before, both ethics and law judge the difference between right and wrong. However, ethics has a very different position in society. Ultimately, ethics is an imagined ideal of what the perfect or best human being could be. The principles of ethics should guide people's decision-making about what is right and wrong, or at least fair. A key difference is that ethics is not written down or legally enforced. Each person will have their own view of right and wrong that will be formed by the people they know and the wider society they live in. Laws are regional, national, or even international. Ethics on the other hand is very much an individual concept.
如上文所说，道德和法律都判断是非曲直。可是道德在社会中的地位跟法律很不一样。说到底，道德是想象中的一个完人可能的样子。道德的标准应该指引人们判断是非对错，或者至少是判断公平合理与否。一个关键的区别在于道德是不成文的，也没有司法强制性。每个人都有自己关于对错的看法，这种看法的形成受他们所认识的人和他们所生活的社会大环境的影响。法律是地区性、国家性或国际性的， 而道德则在很大程度上是一种个人观念。

5 Graphene is also being tested for its potential use in the medical world and early biomedical research has had excellent results. Again, it is its unique structure and properties that make it such an exciting product. Graphene has been shown to potentially both detect and treat many forms of cancer. Chinese scientists have demonstrated that it can be used to create a sensor that can detect even a single cell. It has also been shown to be able to reduce the size of tumors. It even helps to deliver large amounts of cancer drugs to specific parts of the body. While this research is still in its infancy, it shows great promise and has the potential to revolutionize many medical fields.
医学界也在测试石墨烯的应用潜力，早期的生物医学研究已经取得了卓越的成果。石墨烯令医学界振奋的原因同样在于它独特的结构和性能，已有证据显示它或可用于检测和治疗多种癌症。中国科学家研究发现，石墨烯可用来制造一种传感器，可以检测到小到单个细胞。它还能被用来缩小肿瘤，甚至可以将大量抗癌药物输送到身体的特定部位。虽然这项研究尚处于起步阶段，但具有广阔的前景，并有可能使诸多医学领域发生革命性的变化。
